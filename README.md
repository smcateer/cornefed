# Cornefed
An [Ergogen](https://ergogen.xyz/new) keyboard config.

A 233332+3 variation on the [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd). The basic idea is that the pinkie and index stretch rows are only 2 keys high and centred on the home row to make them a bit less stretchy.

Named after the Duckman character because ... ahem, he's a cool piggie.
